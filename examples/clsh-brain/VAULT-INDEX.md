# clsh.dev — Vault Index

> Start here. This is the navigation hub for the entire project vault.

## What is clsh?

**clsh** is a phone-first, open-source tool that gives developers real terminal access to their machine from any device. The primary experience is on your phone — a pixel-perfect MacBook keyboard (not iOS keyboard), tmux session grids with zoom, and customizable keyboard skins. Desktop is also supported with a MacBook Pro frame and three-pane layout. See [[Vision]] for the full product vision.

## Current Progress

**Overall:** 92% (23/25 steps complete)
**Current Phase:** Phase 4 — Post-Launch
**Security:** Steps 4.1a, 4.1b, 4.1d COMPLETE. Step 4.1c nearly done (1 task remaining: security email).
**Launch:** Step 4.2 COMPLETE. Full launch executed across all platforms. Reddit r/ClaudeAI post went viral.
**Immediate Next:** Finish 4.1c (security email) → Step 4.3 Post-Launch
**npm**: `@clsh` org on npmjs.com; packages: clsh-dev@0.1.8, @clsh/web@0.0.4, @clsh/agent@0.0.7
**Audit Report:** [[Security-Audit]] — full code-level findings with file paths and fix instructions
**GitHub:** https://github.com/my-claude-utils/clsh — public, CI green, branch protection on
**Deployment:** clsh.dev LIVE on Cloudflare Pages (www.clsh.dev redirect active, og-image.png deployed)
**Phone UI:** SHIPPED — Grid View → Terminal View → Skin Studio, iOS Terminal keyboard (default) + MacBook keyboard, 6 skins, editable session names, settings panel + cog in session view, ngrok remote access

## Key Decisions

- **Open source first** — MIT license, community-driven
- **Local-first MVP** — ngrok tunnel, no cloud infra needed
- **Future monetization** — Cloud-hosted remote machines (v2)
- **Tech stack** — React + Vite + xterm.js (frontend), Node.js + Express + node-pty (backend), Turborepo monorepo
- **Domain** — clsh.dev (Cloudflare Pages for landing, ngrok for live tunnels)
